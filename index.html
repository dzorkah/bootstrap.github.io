It Allows The Boat Driver To Maneuver Through Waterways By Sitting Face-Forward And Propelling Ahead With Alternating Side-To-Side Paddle Strokes. The Paddler Sits In The Cockpit With The Legs Extended Beneath A Closed Deck, Leaving The Upper Body Free And Exposed.The Kayak Has Been Around For Centuries. It Was First Used By The Inuits In The Arctic Regions For Navigating Waterways. It Was A Pragmatic Way To Hunt, Fish, And Transport Passengers Across The Water.
